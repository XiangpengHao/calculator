Allows you to investigate a number in its binary, hexadecimal, and decimal forms. 
Similar to the Windows calculator in programmer mode, but on Web.

Could be helpful to debug memory addresses and bit-packed values, common in system programming. 

Note that every number is **64-bit unsigned integer**, because we system programmers don't use [other types](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/13gt6co/standagainstfloats/#lightbox).

#### Contribution
I don't know much about web / javascript / typescript / svelte / html / css / whatever, I'm open to any contribution.
I tend to [trust your modification](https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27), but please at least ask ChatGPT before sending a PR.
